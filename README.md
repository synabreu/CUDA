# CUDA
In this open sources, I can show you several examples using CUDA. Simply put, What is CUDA? CUDA is an acronym for Compute Unified Device Architecture, created by NVIDIA.

CUDA is a parallel computing platform and application programming interface (API) model created by Nvidia. It allows software developers and software engineers to use a CUDA-enabled graphics processing unit (GPU) for general purpose processing â€“ an approach termed GPGPU (General-Purpose computing on Graphics Processing Units). The CUDA platform is a software layer that gives direct access to the GPU's virtual instruction set and parallel computational elements, for the execution of compute kernels.

The CUDA platform is designed to work with programming languages such as C, C++, and Fortran. This accessibility makes it easier for specialists in parallel programming to use GPU resources, in contrast to prior APIs like Direct3D and OpenGL, which required advanced skills in graphics programming. Also, CUDA supports programming frameworks such as OpenACC and OpenCL.

Therefore, I can show you how to install CUDA SDK on the Windows PC, and Mac, as well as the differences between general C/C++ and CUDA C/C++ using Visual Studio 2015, including NVIDIA NSight Visual Studio Edition.

# 1. Setup CUDA Toolkit 9.0 on the Windows PC 

Just a word before I start how to do, It's so easy to setup this development environment. Also, it is possible to start to develop codes without any NVIDIA's GPU hardware. Successfully, I finished setuping CUDA platform on the Windows 10 using Parrallels Desktop for Mac.

1. Download and Install Visual Studio 2015 Community Edition or Visual Studio 2017 Community Edition.

1) Visual Studio 2017: https://www.visualstudio.com/downloads/
2) Visual Studio 2015: https://my.visualstudio.com/Downloads?q=visual%20studio%202015&wt.mc_id=o~msft~vscom~older-downloads

By upgrading CUDA Toolikt 9.0, NVIDIA supports Visual Studio Community Edition both of version 2015, 2017. 

2. Download and Install CUDA Toolkit 9.0

you can select target platform, architecture and Operating System Version on Windows, Linux or Mac OSX.
